# Amazon-Clone
Welcome to my first HTML/CSS project on GitHub! I'm excited to share this project with you. It's a Amazon website. Using HTML and CSS, I've replicated some of Amazon's key features and design elements to create a familiar browsing experience. As this is my first HTML/CSS project, I'm eager to hear your thoughts and suggestions for improvement.
